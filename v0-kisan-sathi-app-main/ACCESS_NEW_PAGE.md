# ✅ NEW COMBINED PAGE CREATED!                                                    

## 🎯 Access the New Page

I've created a **brand new standalone page** that's easier to access and has VERY OBVIOUS styling.

### URL:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/farm-management/income-expense-combined/
```

## 🎨 What You'll See:

1. **Yellow test banner** at the top saying "THIS IS THE COMBINED INCOME & EXPENSE PAGE"
2. **Blue section** for expenses
3. **Gradient divider** (blue to green)
4. **Green section** for income

## 📝 Steps:

1. Make sure Django server is running
2. Open browser
3. Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/farm-management/income-expense-combined/`
4. You'll see BOTH sections on the same page

## ✅ This Page Has:

- ✅ Very obvious yellow test banner
- ✅ Expense section (blue background)
- ✅ Income section (green background)
- ✅ Both sections fully functional
- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete for both
- ✅ Filters for both
- ✅ Separate modals

## 🔄 If Server Needs Restart:

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart:
cd kisan_sathi_backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python manage.py runserver
```

Then go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/farm-management/income-expense-combined/`
